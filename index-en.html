      <p class="intro">
        I graduated from the Graduate Institute of Science and Technology Management at National Chung Hsing University. During my studies, I led design thinking workshops, participated in innovation case competitions, and conducted social impact projects. I have solid experience in UX research, design thinking, and project management, and I’m passionate about transforming complex needs into intuitive product experiences.<br><br>
        In various projects, I’ve worked effectively with stakeholders and collaborators. I’m capable of independently carrying out user interviews, surveys, workshops, and usability tests across the UX process.<br><br>
        I believe that human-centered thinking is the key to successful products. I strive to promote user-centered design and enhance user experience. Feel free to reach out — let’s create impactful solutions together.
